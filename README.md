You can also manage flutter component source code as followsï¼š

1. Configure the source path In the `pubspec.yaml` of the main project, such as:

   ```
   source_config:
     # Loop to check whether each unique element depends on global, if it depends, ignore the active attribute of unique, 
     # the unique element directly becomes the source code to be depended on by the main project, and the unique element also depends on the global source code
     global:
       bangmai_module_base:
         active: true
         path: ../bangmai_module_base
     # Check whether the active of the unique element is activated, if it is activated, it depends on the source code
     unique:
       bangmai_module_workbench:
         active: false
         path: module/bangmai_module_workbench
       bangmai_module_mine:
         active: false
         path: module/bangmai_module_mine
   ```

2. Run `power_command source build` to build source dependencies , Then do what you want in the source code project.

3. Run `power_command source restore` to reset all yaml file configuration.

Note: 

Each command has an abbreviation, usually the first character of the command.

You can run `power_command help` get more details.

```
Global options:
-h, --help    Print this usage information.

Available commands:
  clean    run flutter clean
  custom   run a custom command or its own script
  delete   run delete file, the default is pubspec.lock
  format   run flutter format .
  pub      run flutter pub get (note: this is a parent command)
