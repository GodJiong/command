A useful command line tool for Dart, which support flutter component management, built-in commands and custom command etc.

## Requirements

The latest release of `power_command` requires Dart SDK `2.12.0` or later.

## Installation

`power_command` is not meant to be used as a dependency. Instead, it should be ["activated"](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#activating-a-package).

```
$ dart pub global activate power_command
```

Learn more about activating and using packages [here](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global).

## Update

The same as Installation

## Usage

Standard usage is as follows:

```
power_command <command> [arguments]
```

### Main

You can manage flutter component source code as followsï¼š

1. Configure the source path In the `pubspec.yaml` of the main project, such as:

   ```
   source_config:
     # Loop to check whether each unique element depends on global, if it depends, ignore the active attribute of unique, 
     # the unique element directly becomes the source code to be depended on by the main project, and the unique element also depends on the global source code
     global:
       bangmai_module_base:
         active: false
         path: module/bangmai_module_base
         # Automatically clone the source code from the git configuration to the above path
         git:
           url: 'git@xxx.git'
           ref: 'dev'
     # Check whether the active of the unique element is activated, if it is activated, it depends on the source code
     unique:
       bangmai_module_workbench:
         active: false
         path: module/bangmai_module_workbench
         git:
           url: 'git@xxx.git'
           ref: 'dev'
       bangmai_module_mine:
         active: false
         path: module/bangmai_module_mine
         git:
           url: 'git@xxx.git'
           ref: 'dev'
   ```

2. Run `power_command source build` to build source dependencies , Then do what you want in the source code project.

3. Because the tool will temporarily store a snapshot, after all the functions are developed, don't forget to run  `power_command source restore` to reset all yaml file configuration.

### Others

Run flutter commands as follows: 

```
power_command clean
```

Run built-in commands as follows: 

```
power_command delete a.txt
```

Run custom commands as follows:
